As the UAAA is a member of [url=http://www.nationstates.net/nation=the_an_xileel/detail=factbook/id=294871]the Combine[/url], their spacecraft is large and advanced, known as the Asian Spacefleet. Several spacecraft models are used for military purposes that guard Asian space territory while civilian models are used for interplanetary and stellar transport, as well as being used to transport cargo among Asian planets or Combine territory. Most, if not nearly all, spacecraft in the Asian Spacefleet is capable of FTL travel, have armor plating and firearms as well as containing an Artificial Intelligence.
this is a test thing

All of the aircraft is designed by the [url=http://www.nationstates.net/nation=united_asians_association_of_asians/detail=factbook/id=278536]Asia United Research Company[/url] and manufactured by the government.

[b]Cargo Vessel Series 1 Brahmin[/b]
The Cargo Vessel Series 1 Brahmin, commonly abbreviated as the SR1 Brahmin, is a civilian spacecraft used for transporting interplanetary cargo. It is capable of FTL transport, albeit it is rarely used unless for leaving a quadrant, as well as being fitted with an all-purpose A.I.

The Vessel is armed with the 'primitive' Thanix Cannons when compared to other spacecrafts in the Asian Spacefleet. The Thanix Cannon uses an electromagnetic field to shape and accelerate a stream of superheated molten metal to relativistic velocities, which then impacts its target and deals horrendous damage.

The armor of the fleet relies on its ablative armor meant primarily to defend against the directed energy weapons that kinetic barriers cannot impede. The armor "boils away" when heated.

[box][b]Stealth and Reconnaissance Series 4 Heigui[/b]

The Stealth and Reconnaissance Series 4 Heigui, commonly abbreviated as the SR4 Blackghost in Galatic Common or 系列四黑鬼 in Mandarin, is the standard spacecraft used for reconnaissance and skirmishes. As with most spacecraft, it is capable of FTL transport through its circular drives located in it's hind, also inside is an all-purpose A.I.

The ship is fitted with v.7 LX Cannons, capable of firing pulsed beams which are devastating at close ranges or set-up in the normal-medium distances. It gives off the energy of over 30 petajoules upon firing which are as hot as 5000°K and travels at the speed of light. 

The ship has heavy and ablative armors which can withstand laser beams by scattering them to ease the damage and withstand force, heat and radiation due to it being picoengineered. Multicore kinetic barriers are applied to unceremoniously slap aside projectiles thanks to its specialized mass effect fields. By rotationally firing their mass effect field projectors, the ship creates rapidly oscillating kinetic barriers instead of static ones.

The trademark of the ship is its extremely advanced stealth devices The ship projects a micrometer thick Quantum Vacuum Forcefield in the purposefully left space between the outer hull of the spaceship, which is where all sensors are located, and the outer armor segment of the spaceship . Furthermore, to be able to hide from the naked eye and sensors, the outer hull is covered with nanobots able to rapidly assemble nanostructures with varying light absorption and reflection levels. The nanobots are capable of matching the background color like a Chamelon, making detection through sensors or A.I's nearly impossible.
